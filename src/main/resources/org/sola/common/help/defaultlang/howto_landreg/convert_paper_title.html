       Convert a Paper Title
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This service can be used to convert a paper title into its digital equivalent in SOLA. The
      need to use this service may be triggered by the lodgment of an instrument over a property
      that is not yet recorded in SOLA. This service has no fee associated with it.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a new application with the Convert to Title service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Important:</b> &nbsp;Note the folio reference (i.e. Lot/parcel number and Plan
            number) for the title to be converted on the Property tab of Application Details and
            click the Add property button. This will be used as the folio reference for the new
            property record in SOLA.&nbsp; If you omit a folio reference here you will not be able
            to<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/start.png">Start the Convert to Title service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add an Office Note document to the application that describes why the title is being
            converted into SOLA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scan the paper title and attach this to a Title Certificate document on the application
          </li>
          <li>
            Lodge the new application. You do not need to print the lodgment notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the application and check the Fee paid flag on the Fees tab. If you do not have
            permission to check this flag, arrange for your team leader to check it on your behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign the application with the Convert to Title service to yourself.

            Open the assigned application and start the Covert to Title service.
          </li>
          <li>
            SOLA will open the Property Details screen with the folio reference for the new
            property already set. Verify this matches the paper title. If the folio reference is
            not correct, close the Property Details screen without saving and update the property
            details on the Property tab of the Application Details screen and try to<img hspace="4"

            exists in SOLA. If it does, click the result in the results list then click the Select
            button. If the parcel matching the folio reference does not exist in SOLA, complete the
            New parcel details as appropriate and click the Create button. The Type should be set
            to Parcel. The Survey Plan Reference can be left blank.

            Start by creating the primary right for the property (must be one of Freehold,

            Ensure the Is primary right checkbox is checked and enter an appropriate Registration

            Add any other current rights or restrictions (i.e. mortgages, caveats, etc) noted on
            the paper title to the property by selecting the appropriate type of right/restriction
            in the Right type drop down and clicking<img hspace="4" src=

              <li>
                Note that the prior title should have a status of Historic. If it is Current, then
                that indicates the prior title is live. You should investigate further to determine
                if the prior title should remain live or whether it must be cancelled as part of
                converting the paper title (using the Cancel Title service).
