       SOLA Samoa provides functionality to capture and record details for Unit Title Developments
      through a series of Unit Title services.&nbsp; Those services are

    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>

       As yet, no Unit Title Developments have been lodged in Samoa. To avoid incorrect or mistaken
      use of the SOLA Unit Title functionality, the services listed above have been disabled
      preventing them from being selected on the Add Service dialog in the Application Details
      screen. When required, the Unit Title services can be enabled using the Reference data &gt;
      Application &gt; Request types screen of the SOLA Admin application. Refer to the SOLA
      Administrators Guide for details.
