       Record Easements - Create New Title
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       An easement is a right to use the property of another without possessing it. A good example
      is a right of way where access to a property may be granted across the property of another.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Easements over property can be in favor of one or more named right holders, but are more
      commonly in favor of another property (e.g. Right of Way). SOLA allows you to record the
      Easement on the Servient estate (i.e. the property that is the subject of the Easement).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Often easements are identified on a new survey plan and affect the new titles that are to be
      created. The Create New Title service allows you to register an easement over a property as
      part of creating the new title. Note that the easement must always be recorded on the
      Servient estate.
