       Print a Certificate of&nbsp;Title
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The ability to produce a Certificate of Title (CoT) instead of the Computer Folio
      Certificate (CFC) has been added into version v2001a of SOLA. The cutover date from CFC's to
      CoT's is currently proposed for the 2nd March 2021. This date is the 12-year milestone since
      CFC's were introduced, however this date may be changed depending on the readiness of parties
      to accept the CoTs (i.e. banks, MNRE, land owners, etc).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Important:</b> Once the cutover date is agreed, SOLA will require a configuration change
      before it will be possible to produce the CoT's.
    </p>

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use Property Search to locate the property to print the CoT and open Property Details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expand the Print Options dropdown to click <img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/print.png"> Certificate to generate the CoT.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Important:</b> Following the cutover date, CFC's will continue to be produced as the
      search copy for all property until such time as a dealing is registered on a property.
      Dealing registration will trigger the CoT to be produced for that property and any subsequent
      dealings or search copies for that property will also produce the CoT. This will ensure
      current holders of CFC's are not disadvantaged by needing to produce additional proof of
      ownership information after the CoT cutover date.
