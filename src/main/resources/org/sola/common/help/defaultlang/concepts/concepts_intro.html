       SOLA&nbsp;Concepts
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       While using this guide you will encounter a number of terms representing SOLA concepts. A
      description for these concepts and how they should be interpreted in the context of SOLA is
      provided here.

             An individual or organization that is requesting information or changes to the land
            registry and/or cadastre information recorded in SOLA. This could be a lawyer or
            surveyor under instruction from the property owner, the property owner themselves or a
            third party with a vested interest in a particular property. The request made by the
            agent is managed in SOLA as an application. &nbsp;

        </td>
        <td>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             Applications capture details and manage requests received by the land administration
            agency to change, update or report on land registry and/or cadastre information.
            Applications have a lifecycle and transition into different states as the land
            administration agency processes the request that instigated the application. The
            primary role of an application is to implement case management functionality in SOLA.

          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             SOLA employs business rules to automatically validate the data entered by a user to
            ensure consistency of the data as well as warning the user of potential irregularities.
            Business rules are usually executed just prior to changes in state of an application or
            a service (e.g. application approval) but can also be manually triggered using the
            Validation tool in the Application Details screen.
          </p>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             All business rules have a severity rating and the failure of any critical business
            rule will cause the current action to be aborted. In this situation, the user will be
            required to remedy the issue reported by the failed critical rule(s) before processing
            can continue.&nbsp;

             <b>Cadastre (a.k.a. Cadastral Network)</b>
          </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             Represents the information recorded in SOLA about all of the parcels under the
            jurisdiction of the land administration agency. A key component of the cadastre is the
            spatial definition of parcels as this illustrates the shape, geographic location as
            well as the spatial relationship (i.e. topology) between parcels.
          </p>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             SOLA validates all changes that occur to the spatial definition of parcels in order to
            prevent the formation of gaps and overlaps between adjacent parcels that would
            otherwise compromise the integrity of the cadastre.

        </td>
        <td>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             Documents are records created in SOLA that capture summary details about legal,
            official or other documentation supplied by the agent to support their request for
            changes to the land registry and/or cadastre information. Typically documentation is
            provided in paper form and must be scanned into digital format so that it can be
            attached to the document records created for the application.
          </p>
          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             SOLA includes a number of document types to help categorize the documentation received
            and also requires certain document types to accompany services.

          <p style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
             Represents an area of land or water. Parcels captured in SOLA should have a spatial
            definition that illustrates the shape and geographic location of the parcel although
            this is not a mandatory requirement. Parcels without a spatial definition may be
            referred to as A-spatial or Textual parcels.

            rights and restrictions. The information represented by the property is often referred
            to as the Title. For SOLA Samoa, a property is the equivalent of a Computer Folio.

            cadastre information recorded in SOLA. Services broadly identify the actions the land
            administration agency will undertake for the application. Every application lodged in
            SOLA must include at least one service.
