             Identifies the fees payable to the land administration agency before the application
            can proceed. This fee is based on the service(s) selected for the application and the
            number of new lots to create (survey services only). The fee is automatically
            calculated when a new application is lodged.

             SOLA prevents assignment of applications that have not had their fees paid. Once the
            client or agent has paid the application fee, you can flag the application for further
            processing by checking the Paid checkbox. At the same time you can optionally record
            the amount paid as well as any receipt numbers. Note that the Paid checkbox will only
            be editable if you have the appropriate user role.&nbsp;
