       Add or Edit Agents and Banks
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Agents are listed in the Agent drop down on the Application Details screen and are required
      to lodge new Applications. Banks are required when entering or modifying mortgage details.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Party search screen allows you to quickly locate and add or modify agent and bank
      details. To locate all agents in SOLA, search using the Lodging Agent role. To locate all
      banks, search using the Bank role. You can edit the agent or bank details by selecting the
      appropriate search result and clicking the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/pencil.png">Edit tool. This will open the Party Details screen.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       For agents you should enter the contact person details on the Additional Information tab.
      This information will display as the contact person details when you select an agent from the
      Agent dropdown list in Application Details.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When adding a new Agent or a new Bank, make sure you configure the appropriate party
      role(s). For Surveyors, the roles required are Lodging Agent and Surveyor. For Lawyers, add
      the Lodging Agent and Lawyer roles. Banks only require the Bank role.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you need to remove an Agent or Bank so they are no longer available for selection when
      lodging a new application or modifying mortgage details, simply remove the Lodging Agent or
      Bank role from the party record. You can try to use the Party search remove function, but
      that may fail if the agent or bank has already been linked to an application or mortgage.
