       Record Power of Attorney
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This service is used to register a Power of Attorney that authorises a person (attorney) to
      act on behalf of another (grantor) in private affairs, business or some other legal matter.
      Once registered, the Power of Attorney can be associated to any application to support
      property transactions made under the Power of Attorney.

          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the appropriate agent from the Agent dropdown. If the person
            making the request is not listed in the drop down list, choose the Other Agent option
            at the top of the list and enter the contact details for the person in the fields
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add the Record Power of Attorney service to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            This service does not directly reference a property so no property information is
            required on the Property tab. &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the person
            registering the POA. At a minimum the Record Power of Attorney service requires a Power
            of Attorney document. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can optionally enter a reference number for the document and a description. The
                reference number should be taken from the physical document. If the physical
                document does not have any reference number, then this field should be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. E.g. For the POA, this may be the name of the grantor. This field is
                optional and can be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Important:</b> Use the Attachment field to link in the scanned image of the POA.
                It is not possible to link the scanned image of the POA to the document after it is
                added to the application. If you forget to link the image, or link the wrong image,
                remove the document from the application and re-add it with the appropriate image
                file attachment.
