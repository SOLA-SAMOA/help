       Record Ownership
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Ownership details are linked to the primary right for the property and each property should
      only have one active primary right. The primary rights supported by SOLA Samoa are Freehold,
      Leasehold, Customary and Government. These rights represent the estate type for the property.
      To create a primary right and record ownership details on a new property you can use the
      Create New Title or Convert to Title services.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       There may also be situations where the property information migrated from LRS does not
      include ownership details. In this case you can add the ownership details to the property
      using the Change Estate Type or Correct Registry services. The Record Proclamation service
      can also change the estate type of a property when it is taken for public purposes.

            Tick the Primary Right checkbox (if not checked) to indicate this is the primary right

          <li>
            Ownership rights consist of one or more shares which are expressed as fractions.&nbsp;
            The fractions from all current shares on the property must sum to 1. To enter a new
            share for the property, click<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/add.png">Add in the
            Shares section.
          </li>
          <li>
            A share may be allocated to one or more parties. A party can be an individual or an
            entity. Shares that are allocated to more than one individual or more than one entity
            are considered undivided (a.k.a. joint tenants). This means SOLA does not record the
            exact share for each party simply that multiple parties participate in the same share.
            The following illustrates an undivided share between John and Jane Smith.&nbsp; In this
            case the share is 1/2 meaning John and Jane own a half of the property between them,
            however the percentage owned by John vs the percentage owned by Jane is not
            specified.&nbsp;
