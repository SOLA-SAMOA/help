       Change the Map
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Change Map screen allows you to change the boundaries of an existing parcel both
      entirely and point by point (adding nodes and changing node coordinates) outside of the
      receipt of a plan. This may be required due to general maintenance of the cadastral network,
      correction of erroneous data and/or changes to official road names, etc.

       Lodge an Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To perform Change Map, you must lodge a new application in SOLA containing a Change Map
      service. &nbsp;The only documentation required is an Office Note that describes the change
      being made as well as the reason for the change.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Discuss and confirm the changes required with your team leader.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the Other Agent and enter your details as the contact
            person.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add the Change Map service to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can optionally list the parcels affected by the application on the Property tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, create an Office Note document and attach the documentation that
            describes the change and clarifies why the change is being made. &nbsp;Enter today’s
            date for the document and MNRE as the Source Agency. The other fields can remain blank
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Map points tab, navigate the map to the location of the plan and add one or more
            application points using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Fees tab, check the Fee Paid checkbox as the Change Map service does not incur
            any fees, then&nbsp;click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save
            button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgment notice. You can close
            the lodgment notice without printing it. If you do not have permission to check the Fee
            Paid checkbox, save the application and arrange for a person with the appropriate
            privilege to do this for you.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Assign the Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before work can begin on changing the map, the application must first get assigned to a QA
      user. Assignment of the application indicates that work on the application is underway.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">

        <ol>
          <li>
            Assuming the Fee Paid checkbox is checked, select the application in the Unassigned
            applications list and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/assign.png">Assign
            tool. This will open the Application Assignment screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign action is complete,
            you will be returned to the Dashboard and the assigned application will appear in your
            Assigned applications list.

       Change Map Service
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Change Map service provides tools that allow you to modify the existing cadastral
      network. The following describes the basic process flow for changing the map. Variations to
      this basic flow are possible.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard,<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/folder-open-document.png">Open
            the application from your Assigned applications list.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, select the Change Map&nbsp;service and click the<img hspace="4"
            src="../images/icons/start.png">Start tool. This will open the Change Map&nbsp;screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Map Viewer is not already zoomed to the location of the change, use the map
            search or the map navigation tools to locate the appropriate area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Node tools and/or Boundary Change tools to update the parcels that require
            modification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
               Create, edit or remove any hydro parcels or road centerlines using the Spatial
              Feature tools.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all of the relevant information from the plan has been captured into SOLA, return
            to the Services tab of the Application Details screen, select the Change Map service
            and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/confirm.png">Complete tool. This will
            run the SOLA business rules to validate the application data. If there is a critical
            failure, you must remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the
            application otherwise.

          <li>
            The act of saving and/or completing the service will cause the SOLA business rules to
            run validating the state of the data. If you receive rule failures, check Appendix 1 –
            SOLA Business Rules to determine how those failures can be remedied.

       Approval
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The changes you make to the cadastral network while recording using the Change Map tools
      remain pending until the application is approved. Survey approval in SOLA can be achieved
      using the<img style=" margin-left: 40.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/approve.png">Approve action in the Application action dropdown. Official
      approval from MNRE’s CEO or ACEO for the Change Map service should not be required.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open the application from your Assigned applications list and use the<img hspace="4"
            src="../images/icons/validation.png">Validate tool to check the status of the
            application data. If there are any rule failures, review the application data and
            correct the issues as appropriate before proceeding to approve the application.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/approve.png">Approve action in the Application action dropdown to
            approve the application. This will update the status of the application to Approved as
            well as update the cadastral network with the recorded changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the approve action is successful it will generate an Approval notice. It is not
            necessary to print this notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following approval, you can complete the application immediately using the<img style=
