       Add a Plan Image for Digitizing
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When performing a Record Plan or Change Map service, you can choose to add an image of the
      plan to the Map Viewer to assist with digitizing the survey point data directly from the
      plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available on your local
      hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are TIFF, PNG and JPEG. Before
      adding the image, you should also select the target parcels as they may be difficult to
      select after the image is added.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-add.png">Add
      Image tool works by matching two points you select on the map with two points you select from
      the image. Before adding the image, you should compare the plan to the Map Viewer and
      identify two candidate parcel nodes that exist on both the plan and the Map Viewer.&nbsp; For
      the best match accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom left of the plan
      image and the second point at the top right (or top left and bottom right). Note that the
      current Add image tool does not rotate the image. If the plan does not have the standard
      North orientation, then you will need to use an image editing tool to rotate the plan image
      so that North on the plan corresponds with North in the Map Viewer (i.e. toward the top of
      your computer screen). If you are unable to rotate the plan image, do not attempt to digitize
      from the plan as the result will be inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once you have the image file ready, identified the two matching points and selected your
      target parcels, click the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/image-add.png">Add image tool. You will be prompted to select the first of
      two points on the Map Viewer. Zoom in if necessary to ensure your selection is accurate. You
      will then be prompted to select a second point. Again, zoom in if necessary to ensure your
      selection is accurate.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Add Image tool will then prompt you to select your image file from your local hard
      drive. Upon making your selection, the image file will be displayed in the Add Image Preview
      dialog. You can enlarge this dialog as necessary to improve your selection accuracy. Click
      the image at the location matching the first point you selected from the map. A green cross
      will appear on the image. Click the image at the location matching the second point from the
      map and a second green cross will appear.
    </p>

       <b>Add Image Preview dialog with two selections</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To proceed, click the OK button on the Add Image Preview dialog. The image will be scaled as
      required and displayed in the Map Viewer.&nbsp; The image will display on top of the standard
      Map Viewer navigation layers, but will appear below the editing layers added for Record Plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you make a mistake, you can remove the image from the Map Viewer using the<img style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/image-remove.png">Remove Image tool
      and re-add the image. You can also change your selections in the Add Image Preview dialog by
      re-selecting the location of the first point after you have added the second point. Be aware
      that re-selecting the first point will require you to re-select your second point as well.
