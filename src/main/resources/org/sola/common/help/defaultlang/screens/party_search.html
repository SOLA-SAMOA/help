       Party Search
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Party Search screen allows you to locate parties which include both people (Natural
      Person) and organizations/groups (Non-natural Person) that are associated to property or
      property transactions. You can also add, edit, remove or view party details from this screen.
      It can be accessed by selecting<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/users.png">Party or Search &gt; Party.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" align="center">

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" align="center">
       <b>Party Search</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       You can search by any combination of Name, Type and Role. The Name also supports partial and
      full matching. &nbsp;SOLA makes no attempt to automatically link or de-duplicate new party
      records. This can result in an individual or organization/group being listed multiple times
      in the search results.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Is right holder flag indicates whether the party has a direct association to a property
      as an owner or as a named party for another property right. Parties that are flagged as right
      holders cannot be edited or removed using this screen. Instead changes to the right holder
      details can only be made using the appropriate service.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Using this screen you can add a new party by clicking<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"
      hspace="4" src="../images/icons/add.png">Add or edit existing parties that are not flagged as
      right holders by selecting a search result and clicking<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"
      hspace="4" src="../images/icons/pencil.png">Edit. Both actions will open the Persons Details
      screen allowing you to enter details for an individual or an entity. It is also possible to
      add new parties as well as edit parties using other functions in SOLA such as contact
      persons, property owners and right holders.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To remove an existing party, select it and click<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace=
      "4" src="../images/icons/remove.png">Remove. If the party is not linked as an agent, property
      owner or right holder, the record will be removed.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you simply need to view the party details, select it and click<img style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/view.png">View.
