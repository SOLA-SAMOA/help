       To assist capturing the location of survey points from the plan, you can load an image of
      the survey plan onto the Map Viewer and use the mouse to capture the location of the new
      survey points.

       To add a plan image to the map you must first have an image file available on your local
      hard drive. The file formats supported by the Map Viewer are TIFF, PNG and JPEG. If you have
      an image in a different format (e.g. PDF), then you will need to convert the file to one of
      the accepted image formats before it can be displayed in the Map Viewer.

      Image tool works by matching two points you select on the map with two points you select from
      the image. For the best match accuracy, the first node you select should be at the bottom
      left of the plan image and the second point at the top right (or top left and bottom right).
      The image is then scaled and displayed in the Map Viewer accordingly.

       Note that the current Add image tool does not rotate the image. If the plan does not have a
      standard North orientation, then do not attempt to digitize from the plan as the result will
      be inaccurate.
