       Documents are records created in SOLA that capture summary details about legal, official or
      other documentation supplied by the agent to support their request for changes to the land
      registry and/or cadastre information. SOLA allows documents to be added and/or linked to
      applications, properties and RRRs. The primary way to add documents into SOLA is via the
      Documents tab on the Application Details screen.
