       Locate and Link a Power&nbsp;of Attorney
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Power of Attorney documents are treated much the same way as Standard Memorandum documents
      by SOLA. Registered Power of Attorney documents can be linked into new applications to
      justify changes to the property or properties affected by an application as well as linked to
      specific property rights and restrictions such as an ownership right. To identify whether a
      POA applies to a specific application and/or property, it is necessary to first search for
      the POA using the Power of Attorney search tab on the Document search screen and review the
      contents of the POA document.

            When creating a new application that must reference a Power of Attorney or Standard
            Memorandum, use the Documents tab to enter details appropriate for the POA or Standard
            Memorandum
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the File Attachment Document search tab to search for and locate the POA or
            Standard Memorandum document and attach this to your new application
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue with application lodgement as per normal.
          </li>

       <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Document search will only show registered Power of Attorney and Standard Memorandum
        documents. It is not possible to link to documents that are not registered or have been
        revoked.
