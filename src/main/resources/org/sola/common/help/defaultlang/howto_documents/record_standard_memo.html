       This service can be used to register documents that provide standard memorandum (i.e. terms
      and conditions) used by banks for mortgages and leases. These standard documents can be
      linked directly to new applications avoiding duplication and unnecessary scanning.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The process for recording a Standard Memorandum is very similar to that for recording a
      Power of Attorney. Refer to the steps described in the Record Power of Attorney section for
      guidance. Note that the document type to create on the application is Standard Memorandum.
