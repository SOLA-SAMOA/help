       Like applications, services can also exist in different states which they transition to via
      service actions.&nbsp; The actions you can apply to a service are
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       &nbsp;
    </p>
    <table style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">

        <td valign="top">
          <p>
             This action is triggered when you save a new service for the first time. The Lodge
            action causes the service to be assigned the Lodged state.
          </p>

             To start processing the service, use the Start tool on the Application Details Service
            tab toolbar. The Start action transitions the service into the Pending state.
          </p>
          <p>
             The Start tool is available when the application is assigned and one of the services
            in the services list is selected.

             If a service is no longer required or is inappropriate for the application, the
            service can be cancelled using the Cancel tool on the Application Details Service tab
            toolbar. The Cancel action transitions the service into the Cancelled state. Note that
            all services must be in a state of Cancelled or Completed before the application can be
            approved.
          </p>
          <p>
             The Cancel tool is available when the application is assigned and one of the services

             To complete processing of the service, use the Complete tool on the Application
            Details Service tab toolbar. The Complete action executes business rules for the
            service and transitions it into the Complete state if the rule checks are successful.
            Note that all services must be in a state of Cancelled or Completed before the
            application can be approved.

             During quality review or approval, if the user determines a service requires further
            attention, they can reset the status of the service using the Revert tool on the
            Application Details Service tab toolbar. The Revert action transitions the service back
            to the Pending state for further processing.
          </p>
          <p>
             The Revert tool is available when the Application is assigned and the selected service
            has a Completed status.
