    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This service is used to indicate a certified true copy of a title has been requested. The
      request may be received from an agent or a member of the public seeking to obtain information
      about a particular property. It requires printing and certifying (i.e. stamping) the Computer
      Folio Certificate for the named property.

            provided.

            On the Property tab, enter the folio references for the property or properties that
            have been requested. You can quickly check if SOLA records information about a property
            using the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/verify.png">Verify tool. If the Titles
            Exist flag remains unchecked, it means SOLA does not contain a record for the property
            and will not be possible to produce a Computer Folio Certificate.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
