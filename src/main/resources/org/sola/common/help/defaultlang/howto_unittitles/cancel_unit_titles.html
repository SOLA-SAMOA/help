       A Unit Title Development may be cancelled due to two main reasons
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            An application by the registered properties
          </li>
          <li>
            An application to the Court
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To cancel a Unit Title Development, you need to use the Cancel Unit Plan service.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge an application with the Cancel Unit Plan service. You must reference a folio from
            the Unit Title Development on the Property tab. The recommended folio to use is the
            Common Property folio (e.g. CP/11000).
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure you are Assignee for the application with the Cancel Unit Plan service and open
            it from your Dashboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab,<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/start.png">Start the Cancel
            Unit Plan service. This will open the Unit Title screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to the Strata Properties tab and click the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/stop.png">Terminate tool. This will flag all of the unit title folios
            for cancellation. You will be able to confirm the cancellation has been set
            successfully as the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/stop.png">Terminate tool will
            be replaced with the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/undo.png">Cancel termination
            tool. The<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/undo.png">Cancel termination tool can be
            used to undo the cancellation up until approval of the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Close the Unit Titles screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/confirm.png">Complete the Cancel Unit Plan
            service. If any business rule failures occur, verify the cause of the failures and fix
            the errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue processing the application and use the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/approve.png">Approve tool to cancel all of the unit title folios.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            At approval of the Cancel Unit Plan application, all of the unit title folios will be
            made historic including the Common Property folio. If the underlying property is a
            Freehold estate, it will be re-instated and all unit owners from the Unit Title
            Development will gain a share in the underlying property. The shares allocated to each
            unit title owner will be based on their unit entitlement and the share structure from
            their unit title folio. <b>Important:</b> If any unit title folio has a complex
            ownership structure, you should verify the share allocations calculated by SOLA as
            there can be minor inaccuracies due to mathematical rounding.&nbsp; Where inaccuracies
            are detected, use a Correct Registry service to fix the allocations.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            If the underlying property is Leasehold, the unit title folios will be cancelled
            however the Leasehold property will remain unchanged.
