        <h1>Application Lifecycle</h1>

        <p>Applications can exist in different states as they are processed through SOLA. 
            To transition an application into a different state you need to trigger an action, 
            although not every action causes the application to change state. The actions you can 
            apply to an application are:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Lodge &#8211; This action is triggered when you save a new application for the first time. 
                The Lodge action causes the application to be assigned the Lodged state. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Validate &#8211; Validates the details of the application and presents the results on the 
                Validations tab of the Application Details screen. To validate an application, use the 
                Validate tool in the Application Details toolbar. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Assign &#8211; Assigns the application to the nominated user. Triggered from the 
                Application Assignment screen. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Un-assign &#8211; Un-assigns the user currently assigned to the application. Triggered 
                from the Application Assignment screen. <br></li>
            <li>Requisition &#8211; An application may be requisitioned when further information is 
                required from the applicant or the agent using the Requisition tool in the Application 
                Details toolbar. The Requisition action transitions the application into the Requisitioned 
                state effectively placing it on hold until the additional information is received. The 
                Requisition tool is only available when the application is in a Lodged state and is 
                assigned to a user. <br> </li>
            <li>Resubmit &#8211; Once the applicant or agent supplies the necessary information, the 
                application can be resubmitted for further processing using the Resubmit tool in the 
                Application Details toolbar. This tool is only available when the application is in a 
                Requisitioned state and is assigned to a user. <br> 
            </li>
            <li>Withdraw &#8211; Applicants and/or agents can request the application to be withdrawn 
                prior to approval. To withdraw an application, use the Withdraw tool in the Application 
                Details toolbar. The Withdraw action transitions the application into the Annulled state. 
                The Withdraw tool is available when the application is in a Lodged or Requisitioned 
                state and is assigned to a user.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Lapse &#8211; Applications that remain requisitioned for an extended period without 
                response from the applicant or agent may lapse. To lapse an application, use the Lapse 
                tool in the Application Details toolbar. The Lapse action transitions the application 
                into the Annulled state. The Lapse tool is only available when the application is in 
                a Requisitioned state and is assigned to a user.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Cancel &#8211; Applications that are created by mistake, have become invalid or are 
                rejected following assessment can be cancelled at the discretion of the land 
                administration agency using the Cancel tool in the Application Details toolbar. 
                The Cancel action transitions the application into the Annulled state. The Cancel 
                tool is only available when the application is in a Lodged state.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Approve &#8211; Following assessment of the application and completion of all services 
                (completion or cancellation), the application may be approved using the Approve tool in 
                the Application Details toolbar. The Approve action executes the approve business rules 
                for the application and transitions it into the Approved state if the rule checks are 
                successful. The Approve tool is only available when the application is in a Lodged state, 
                is assigned to a user and all services for the application are in either a Completed 
                or Cancelled state.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Dispatch &#8211; Notifications (e.g. emails, letters and telephone calls) to the 
                applicant or agent can be noted against the application using the Dispatch tool in the 
                Application Details toolbar. Where practical, the notification should also be attached 
                to the application as a document for future reference. The Dispatch tool is only 
                available when the application is in an Approved, Requisitioned or Annulled state.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Archive &#8211; When all processing is complete and the appropriate notifications 
                dispatched, the application can be completed using the Archive tool in the Application 
                Details toolbar. The Archive action transitions the application into the Completed state. 
                The Archive tool is only available when the application is in an Approved or 
                Annulled state.<br>
            </li>
        </ul>

            different actions have on application state. <br></p>
