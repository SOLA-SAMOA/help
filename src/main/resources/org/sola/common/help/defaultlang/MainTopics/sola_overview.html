        <h1>Solutions for Open Land Administration (SOLA)</h1>

        <p>In December 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
            (FAO) successfully concluded the Solutions for Open Land Administration 
            (SOLA) project. The 2.5 year project was funded by the Government of 
            Finland and dedicated to implementing an open source computerised 
            cadastre and registration system that is both affordable and sustainable 
            in the context of developing countries. The open source software produced
            by the SOLA project (also called SOLA) was based on international good 
            practice for service delivery, responsible governance of tenure
            (including transparency of process and transparency of tenure details), 
            robust data management and the need for enterprise scale software. 
            The underlying data structures used by the SOLA software are also 
            based on the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM), now published 
            as ISO 19152 by the International Organization for Standardization 
            (ISO). </p>

        <p>
            As the laws and practices governing land administration are often 
            unique to a given country, SOLA was designed to be customisable 
            so that it could appropriately reflect the laws and practices of 
            the host country. To test the effectiveness of the software and the 
            approach used for customisation, the SOLA project included three pilot 
            implementations in Ghana, Nepal and Samoa. Each pilot implementation 
            was undertaken by a team of local software developers who were first 
            trained by an FAO SOLA mentor so they could undertake the required 
            customizations, support the pilot implementations and maintain the 
            software. Each pilot presented its own challenges with many lessons 
            learned by the FAO SOLA Team along the way. </p>

        <p> The initial software development effort was completed on February 2012 
            and pilot implementations of SOLA began in Samoa and Nepal in March 
            2012 and in Ghana customization work will begin in May 2012. </p>

        <h2>Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment</h2>

        <p> The Independent State of Samoa gained independence in 1962 having
            been administered by Germany (1900 – 1914) and then New Zealand 
            (as a United Nations Trust Territory from 1945 – 1961). It has a 
            population of 186,340 (October 2011 Census) and a land area of 
            2,831 square kilometres. Agriculture (primarily coconut based 
            products), fishing, tourism and remittances from Samoans working 
            overseas are the main contributors to the Samoan economy. 
            All government cadastral and registration services are provided by 
            the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE) whose 
            offices are all located in the capital Apia (on the island of Upolu).
            Apia is also the main commercial centre of Samoa and most of the 
            private sector surveyors licenced to undertake cadastral surveys 
            are based there too. </p>

        <p>80 percent of the land in Samoa is held under customary ownership 
            and this land is protected under the constitution. Samoan 
            society is still strongly focused on village life and the 
            associated traditions. Customary land is not owned individually 
            but communally with most land being associated with a chiefly 
            (matai) title. The matai has authority (pule) to decide on the
            permitted uses for that land by other members of his family group. 
            One forum for the resolution of disputes concerning customary land 
            is the Land and Titles Court (but it should be noted that "Titles" 
            in this case mean chiefly titles).</p>

        <p> The remaining non-customary land consists of 12 percent of freehold
            land and 8 percent of public land. Cadastral and registration 
            records of parcels of land within these non-customary categories 
            of land are recorded within the formal cadastral and registration 
            systems. A small number of blocks of customary land subject to a 
            lease are also with the formal systems. The computerised cadastral
            mapping system, known as Samoa View, has 21,000 parcel records 
            (July 2009). The computerised Land Registration System holds 12,000 
            current titles.</p>

        <h3>Cadastral Arrangements</h3>

        <p> Cadastral surveys are undertaken under the Survey Ordinance 1961. 
            New legislation for cadastral surveys under the Survey Act 2010 
            have been passed by Parliament and implemented by MNRE. Any change in boundaries for freehold or Government land (or for the registration of a lease over customary land) requires a cadastral survey signed by a registered surveyor. Most of these surveys are performed by private sector surveyors. A survey plan is lodged with the MNRE where it is checked by the Quality Assurance Section of the Technical Division. Once the survey is considered to meet all requirements (including the standards described in the Survey Regulations) the survey is approved by the Chief Executive Officer. The survey is then able to support registration actions including the issuance of new titles. Once the survey is approved the new boundaries are recorded in the (computerised) Samoa View mapping system.  </p>

        <h3>Registration Arrangements</h3>

        <p>Samoa moved to a system of title registration with the implementation of the Land Title Registration Act 2008 on 2 March 2009. This change was accompanied by the introduction of standardised forms, the implementation of a computerised system and the legal recognition of the computer based records, in particular the "computer folio". </p>
		
<p>Although it is possible for individuals to complete their own documents for registration, it is common practice for people needing to register a land transaction to engage the services of private lawyer to prepare and lodge the necessary documents with the MNRE. Details are entered into the computerised system at the time of lodgement. Staff from the Registration Section scan all lodged documents and associate them with the lodgement record, which has also been referenced to the appropriate computer folio (title) at the time of lodgement data entry. Land registration staff then check that the lodged documents are able to registered. Once these checks are done the Registrar registers the transaction and the computer folio is automatically updated to reflect the new registration.</p>

<p>The public and MNRE staff can also request various computer folio search products and these are produced by the computerised system. Likewise the computerised system creates new computer folio certificates when a new survey plan is registered (as well as cancelling the superseded computer folios). </p>

<h2>SOLA Samoa</h2>

<p>The objectives of SOLA Samoa were to<p>

        <ol>
            <li>Migrate Samoa View (DCDB) to an open source environment that supports cadastral mapping functions, processing of lodged cadastral survey plans, cadastral map and survey plan searches.</li>
            <li>Migrate the Land Registration System (LRS) to an open source environment that supports dealing registration functionality, computer folio (title) certificates and existing LRS search products. </li>
            <li>Provide read only access to cadastral map information via a GIS viewer to all MNRE staff.  </li>
            <li>Provide read only access to selected title registration information to all MNRE staff.</li>
            <li>Implement enhancements supporting Unit (Strata) Titles legislation. </li>
            <li>Implement a Digital Archive to manage scanned registration documents. </li>
            <li>Develop local expertise capable of supporting and enhancing the open source system(s)</li>
        </ol>
