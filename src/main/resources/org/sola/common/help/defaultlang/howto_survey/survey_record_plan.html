       Record a Plan
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA integrates both the cadastral network and land registry into one application, replacing
      both LRS and DCDB. When a new plan is submitted to the ministry for approval (i.e. Survey,
      Complied, Registry, etc), the details from the plan must be recorded in SOLA before titles
      over any new lots can be issued.

       Lodge an Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The first step to record a new plan is to lodge a new application in SOLA containing a
      Record Plan service. This should be done while the surveyor (or their representative) is in
      attendance so that you can provide them with the lodgment notice detailing the fees payable.

    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the surveyor as the Agent. Check the contact details for the
            surveyor are appropriate and update if required. If the surveyor is not listed in the
            drop down list, choose the Other Agent option at the top of the list and enter the
            contact details for the surveyor in the fields provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Important</b>: For some users the Application # field on the General tab may be
            enabled. <b>DO NOT</b> enter a value into this field unless the plan was allocated a
            number by LRS. For details, see the Record a Plan with an Application Number allocated
            by LRS section.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add the Record Plan service to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the folio references for the underlying parcels of the plan
            (i.e. the parcels that will be extinguished by the plan) and add them to the
            application using the Add property button. You should verify each property using
            the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/verify.png">Verify tool to confirm SOLA
            contains the appropriate details to process the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the surveyor.
            At a minimum the Record Plan services requires a Plan document. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can optionally enter a reference number for the document and a description. The
                reference number should be taken from the physical document. If the physical
                document does not have any reference number, then this field should be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. E.g. For the plan, the name of the surveyors firm or the surveyors name
                can be entered here. This field is optional and can be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link in the scanned
                image. If you have not yet scanned the document, you will need to do this at a
                later stage and link it into the document using the Edit Document functionality
                available from Document Search.&nbsp;
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Map points tab, navigate the map to the location of the plan and add one or more
            application points using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Fees tab, enter the number of new lots that will be created by the plan and
            click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save button. This will lodge
            the application and produce the lodgment notice. Print the notice and give it to the
            surveyor (or their representative) as proof the application has been lodged. The
            lodgment notice will indicate the fee to be paid for the application as well as the
            date the application should be completed processing (30 days from the date of
            lodgment).

       Fee Payment
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the lodgment notice is printed, the surveyor will need to take the notice to the
      cashier in the finance section and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier
      will<img style=" margin-left: 40.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/folder-open-document.png">Open the application from the Unassigned
      application list in the SOLA Desktop and check the Fee Paid flag on the Fees tab to indicate
      the application can continue processing.

    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Assign the Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before work can begin on recording the plan information in SOLA, the application must first
      get assigned to a QA user. Assignment of the application indicates that work on the plan is
      underway.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the SOLA Dashboard, check the Unassigned applications list to confirm the fee for
            the application has been paid. If the fee has not been paid it will not be possible to
            assign the application. In this situation contact the surveyor and/or cashier to
            confirm the payment status for the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the application fee has been paid, select the application in the Unassigned
            applications list and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/assign.png">Assign
            tool. This will open the Application Assignment screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign action is complete,
            you will be returned to the Dashboard and the assigned application will appear in your
            Assigned applications list.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Typically users will only be able to assign applications to themselves (i.e. they will be
      able to pull work), however team leaders will be able to manage the workload of their teams
      and will be able to assign and reassign applications to other users. Note that the<img style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/unassign.png">Un-assign and<img

    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Manual Assessment
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The QA user assigned to the application will perform the necessary manual checks to confirm
      the plan complies with the appropriate survey regulations. If the assessment of the plan is
      successful, the QA user can begin recording the details of the plan in SOLA using the Record
      Plan service. If the assessment reveals issues with the plan that must be addressed by the
      surveyor, then the plan will need to be requisitioned.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Requisitioning and Resubmitting the Plan
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When the plan requires requisition it will be necessary to update the application in SOLA to
      the Requisitioned status.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Confirm the plan requires requisition with the appropriate team leader.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the requisition notice describing the issues that need to be addressed by the
            surveyor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the application from the Assigned applications list in the Dashboard. Go to the
            Documents tab and create a new Requisition Notice document with the requisition notice
            as the attachment. Attaching the requisition notice to the application will ensure the
            reasons for requisitioning the plan are recorded in SOLA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the Application action dropdown, select the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/requisition.png">Requisition action. This will update the application
            status to Requisitioned and remove the application from your Assigned applications
            list. If the Requisition action is not enabled on the Application action dropdown,
            confirm the application is assigned to you and that you have the Requisition
            Application role by asking IT Services to check your SOLA User setup.

      "../images/icons/withdraw.png">Withdraw action on the Application action dropdown.
      Alternatively, if the plan remains on requisition for an extended period, and no further
      information is provided by the surveyor, the application can be lapsed using the<img style=

       Record Plan Service
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Record Plan service provides tools that allow you to modify the existing cadastral
      network. The following describes the basic process flow for capturing plan information.
      Variations to this basic flow are possible. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>

    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            If the Map Viewer is not already zoomed to the location of the plan, use the map search
            or the map navigation tools to locate the area of the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/select-parcel.png">Select Target Parcel
            tool to select (or deselect) the underlying parcels. If you have an image of the survey
            plan, you can choose to add the plan image into the Map Viewer to assist with
            digitizing coordinates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Capture the survey points for the plan. You can do this by using the<img hspace="4"
            src="../images/icons/node-linking.png">Create / Link Survey Points tool to locate
            survey points directly on the Map Viewer using the mouse, load new coordinates from a
            survey data file or use the Survey Points screen to manually enter the new coordinate
            details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/node-linking.png">Create / Link Survey
            Points tool to link survey points that represent existing marks to the appropriate
            target parcel nodes. This step is important because it ties the new survey data to the
            underlying cadastral network. Once linked, a survey point will change from being a blue
            plus to a green plus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the Survey Points screen to identify any traverse points from the plan by
            de-selecting/unchecking the Is boundary checkbox. &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the new lots from the plan using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/new-parcel.png">Create New Parcel tool. New lots will automatically
            get assigned the plan number from the application. The lot number will also get
            automatically assigned, however this may need to be manually updated using the Parcel
            List screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/eraser.png">Parcel List tool to open the
            Parcel List screen and enter the Official area for each parcel as noted on the Plan.
            The area should be entered in square meters only.&nbsp; SOLA automatically converts the
            metric measurement to imperial acres, roods and perches for display.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create, edit or remove any hydro parcels or road centerlines using the Spatial Feature
            tools as indicated by the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all of the relevant information from the plan has been captured into SOLA, return
            to the Services tab of the Application Details screen, select the Record Plan Service

       Approving the Plan
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The changes you make to the cadastral network while recording new plan information remain
      pending until the application is approved. Survey approval in SOLA can be achieved using
      the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/approve.png">Approve
      action in the Application action dropdown, however in Samoa the MNRE CEO or ACEO must sign
      the survey plan to officially approve it.

    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Take the survey plan to the CEO or ACEO for signing and approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the plan is officially approved, scan the plan with the CEO’s or ACEO’s signature
            and attach the scanned image to the Plan document of the application.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            If the approve action is successful it will generate an Approval notice. Print the
            Approval notice and get this signed by a team leader.

          <li>
            Dispatch the approval notice and any other relevant information to the surveyor to
            notify them of the approval. You can record that when the approval notice is sent by

        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, enter the Agent details as noted on the application used to process
            the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab add a Cancel Title service if there are properties that must be
            cancelled as a result of the new plan (i.e. properties to cancel for the parcels
            extinguished by the plan). Only one Cancel Title service is required regardless of the
            number of properties that are to be cancelled.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add a Create New Title service for each new lot on the plan that
            requires a title. E.g. if there are 5 lots on the plan that require new titles, add 5
            Create New Title services to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the folio references for the underlying parcels of the plan
            and add them to the application using the Add property button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Important</b>: On the Documents tab, create a Plan document and use the Document
            search to link to the approved plan image that should be recorded on the application
            used to process the plan. The approved plan image will be used by Land Registration to
            determine the titles for the new lots. &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Map points tab, you can optionally navigate the map to the location of the plan
            and add one or more application points using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the fees tab, check the Fee Paid checkbox as the Create New Title service does not
            incur any fees, then click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save
            button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgment notice. You can close
            the lodgment notice without printing it. If you do not have permission to check the Fee
            Paid checkbox, save the application and arrange for a person with the appropriate
            privilege to do this for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the Land Registration application has been lodged, open the application used to
            process the plan and archive it using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/archive.png">Archive action in the Application action dropdown.
