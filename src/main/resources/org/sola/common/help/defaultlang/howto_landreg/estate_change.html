       Change the Type of Estate
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The estate type for the property is determined by its primary right and can be Freehold,
      Leasehold, Government or Leasehold. The Change Estate Type service can be used to change the
      primary right of a property. For example, changing the title from Customary ownership into
      private Freehold ownership, Customary to Government ownership or Freehold to Government
      ownership.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       There may be situations where the property information migrated from LRS does not include
      ownership details. In this case you can add the ownership details to the property using the
      Change Estate Type service.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Change Estate Type service will not allow you to cancel the existing primary right on
      the property. If you must change the primary right for a property you will also need to use
      the Correct Registry (Cancel Right) service to cancel the existing primary right.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Note that changing the estate type of a property is only required when the property must
      maintain its existing folio reference. Where new parcels have been created as a result of a
      survey or complied plan, then the existing property record should be cancelled (Cancel Title
      service) and new titles created (Create New Title service).&nbsp;

          <li>
            Check the property to determine if it has an existing primary right that must be
            cancelled. If so, ensure the Correct Registry (Cancel Right) service is added to the
            application.
