       Record a Plan that has No Coordinates
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If a plan does not have any coordinate data, such as a sketch provided for a customary
      lease, then very little cadastral information from the plan can be captured in SOLA. In this
      case, MNRE are still required to issue a number for the plan and this is where the Record
      Plan with No Coordinates service should be used. This service will ensure SOLA allocates a
      survey plan number, but will not require the user to capture any plan data.

          <li>
            When lodging an application for a plan that has no coordinate data (such as a customary
            lease sketch), add the Record Plan with No Coordinates service to the application
            rather than the Record Plan service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complete the other application details as required and<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/save.png">Save the application. SOLA will generate a survey plan
            number for the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proceed with fee payment, assignment and assessment of the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the plan has been assessed and is ready for approval,<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/start.png">Start the Record Plan with No Coordinates service. You will
            see the progress bar showing the service is being started, however no screen will be
            displayed. Instead the status for the Record Plan with No Coordinates service will
            change from Lodged to Pending. This is the expected behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the status of the service is showing as Pending, select the service and click
            the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/confirm.png">Complete tool. The status of the
            service will change to Completed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proceed with approval of the application.
