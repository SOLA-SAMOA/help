       Applications can exist in different states as they progress through SOLA. To transition an
      application into a different state you need to trigger an action, although not every action
      causes the application to change state. The actions you can apply to an application are

             An application may be requisitioned when further information is required from the

            The Requisition action transitions the application into the Requisitioned state
