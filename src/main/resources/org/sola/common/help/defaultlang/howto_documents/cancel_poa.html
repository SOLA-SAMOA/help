       Cancel Power of&nbsp;Attorney
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       This service is used to revoke a Power of Attorney. The Power of Attorney will remain linked
      to any applications or property transactions it was associated with prior to being revoked
      but it will not be possible to use the Power of Attorney on any new applications.

            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the appropriate agent from the Agent dropdown. If the person
            making the request is not listed in the drop down list, choose the Other Agent option
            at the top of the list and enter the contact details for the person in the fields
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            This service does not directly reference a property so no property information is
            required on the Property tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            No supporting documents are required for this service, so there is no need to enter any
            documents on the Documents tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            No Map points are required.

            Click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save button. This will lodge
            the application and produce the lodgment notice. Print the notice and give it to the
            person as proof the application has been lodged. The lodgment notice will indicate the
            fee to be paid for the application.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the lodgment notice is printed, the person will need to take the notice to the cashier
      in the finance section and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier will
      locate the Unassigned application list on the SOLA Dashboard,<img style=

    <ul>
      <li>
        Revoking the Power of Attorney will not delete it from SOLA, but it will prevent the POA
        being used on any future application.
