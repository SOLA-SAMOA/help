    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Users are required to change their password at regular intervals to reduce the risk of
      SOLA’s audit and security features from being compromised. From time to time you may be
      prompted with the following message when logging into the SOLA Desktop. &nbsp;
    </p>

       <b>Password Due to Expire Message</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When you click OK to this prompt, the User Profile screen will be displayed allowing you to
      change your password.

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter your current password in the Current password field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enter your new password in the New password field. Your new password must differ from
            your old password by at least one character and have a minimum length of 5 characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Re-enter your new password in the Confirm new password field. Be aware that passwords
            are case sensitive so you must re-enter the password exactly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/key.png">Save new password to change your
            password.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your new password is accepted a message will display stating that your password was
            successfully changed and the SOLA Desktop will close.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restart the SOLA Desktop and login using your new password.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA will warn you for up to 10 days that your password is due to expire. If you fail to
      change your password during this period, you will be locked out and you will not be able to
      login. In this situation, contact the System Administrator so they can change your password
      for you. Note that if the Administrator resets your password, you will be prompted to change
      it again the next time you successfully login to the SOLA Desktop.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       If you intend to take extended leave or you feel your password has been compromised then you
      should change your password immediately without waiting for the password expiry message to
      appear. To change your password at any time, open the User Profile and follow the steps as
      above.
