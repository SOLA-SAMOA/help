        <h1>Perform a Cadastre Change</h1>

        <p>You can perform a cadastre change by adding a Cadastre Change service to an 
            application. When the service is started, the Cadastre Change screen will 
            be display. Select the appropriate target parcels and enter the new survey 
            points using the Create / Link Survey Points tool or enter the coordinates 
            directly into the Survey Points screen. Once all survey points have been 
            entered, use the Create / Link Survey Points tool to link the boundary 
            points to the underlying parcel coordinates. When linking is complete, 
            use the Create New Parcel tool to identify the new parcel boundaries and 
            Save the cadastre change. To complete the cadastre change, complete the 
            Cadastre Change service using the Complete tool on the Application Details 
            Services tab and then approve the application. This will cause the new 
            pending parcels to become current and the target parcels to become historic. </p> <br>
