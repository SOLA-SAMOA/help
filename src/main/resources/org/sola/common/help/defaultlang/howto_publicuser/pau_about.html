       About SOLA Public Access
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA Samoa v2001a includes a public user profile that grants public users limited read-only
      access to SOLA suitable for them to search the map and print survey related documentation.
      People wanting to use the public access computer will need to request a SOLA username and
      password from the Public Access Computer Administrator.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Public users must also pay a fee to the cashier on the day(s) they wish to use the public
      access computer. The cashier will issue a receipt and SOLA will prompt public users to enter
      the receipt number when they login. All printouts generated using SOLA will also require a
      fee to be paid. The printer will be in a different part of the MNRE office and will require
      public users to request staff from the MNRE Registration Desk to retrieve the printouts for
      them after they have paid the appropriate amount to the cashier.
