       Change Common Property
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       There are several situations that can trigger a change to the extent of the Common Property.
      These include
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adding land to or removing land from the Common Property
          </li>
          <li>
            Dissolving one or more units into the Common Property
          </li>
          <li>
            Subdividing the Common Property to create new units
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Body Corporate may also sell or grant a lease over the Common Property and/or grant an
      easement.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Add or Remove Land from the Common Property
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To add or remove land from the Common Property will first require subdivision and/or
      amalgamation of the parcel from the underlying property (i.e. the parcel underlying the Unit
      Title Development), which in turn requires cancellation of the underlying property title and
      the creation of the new property titles. These actions must occur before it is possible to
      update the Common Property details.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Important:</b> Never cancel the Common Property folio using the Cancel Title service. The
      Common Property is required by SOLA to link the unit title folios to the underlying property
      as well as record Body Corporate information (i.e. Rules and Address for Service). If all
      land is taken from the Common Property set the official area on the Common Property folio to
      0.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The following describes the general steps that need to be completed. Detailed information
      for each general step can be found in the appropriate How To section.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>General Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create or request a survey plan that shows how the underlying parcel is being
            subdivided and/or amalgamated and use the Record Plan service to capture the details of
            this plan. This will result in the underlying parcel of the Unit Title Development
            becoming historic/cancelled when the survey plan is approved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create new titles for the subdivided/amalgamated land using the Create New Titles
            service and use the Cancel Title service to cancel the folio of the property underlying
            the Unit Title Development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lodge a Redevelopment Plan that shows the new area for the Common Property using a
            Record Unit Plan service. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                On the Unit Titles screen, go to the Map tab, de-select the original underlying
                parcel and select the recently created subdivided/amalgamated parcel as the new
                underlying parcel for the Unit Title Development.
              </li>
              <li>
                Update the Official Area of the Common Property parcel.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there has been any units added to, or removed from the development,<img hspace=

              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Lodge an application with the Create Unit Titles service and edit the Common Property
            folio. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Update the area for the Common Property folio to reflect the new official area of
                the Common Property parcel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the tools on the Related properties tab to disassociate the original Prior
                title reference and add a reference to the new underlying property as the Prior
                title for the Unit Title Development.&nbsp;
              </li>
              <li>
                Update the Corporate Body Rules as required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Update the Unit Entitlements on the Principal Unit folios as required.
              </li>
              <li>
                If new units have been created by the redevelopment, use the<img hspace="4" src=
                "../images/icons/create.png">Create tool to create new stub folios and edit the
                folios to add Unit Entitlements and any other relevant details.
              </li>
              <li>
                If necessary, use the Cancel Title service to cancel any Principal Unit folios that
                may have been removed from the Unit Title Development.
              </li>
            </ol>

       Dissolving Units and/or Subdividing the Common Property
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       For SOLA, dissolving units into the Common Property and/or further subdividing the existing
      Common Property to create new units is the same as processing a Redevelopment Plan. Refer to
      the Lodge a Redevelopment Plan How To section for details on how to deal with this situation.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Leases and Easements over Common Property
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA treats the Common Property folio the same as any other unit or property folio. You can
      register any transaction to the Common Property folio including Leases and Easements by using
      the appropriate service (i.e. Record Lease, Record Easement). Refer to the Land Registration
      How To for further information.
