    <title>Lodge a Plan for a Unit Title Development</title>

    <h1 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Lodge a Plan for a Unit Title Development
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A Unit Title Development Plan (unit plan) identifies the location of all Principal and
      Accessory units along with the Common Property.&nbsp; As with a normal survey plan, the
      Quality Assurance team of MNRE is responsible for assessing the unit plan to ensure it is fit
      for approval and suitable for titles to be issued.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Unit Title Developments can involve strata parcels (i.e. parcels that overlap in 3D space
      such as the floors of a multi-story apartment building). As SOLA only provides 2D mapping
      capabilities it does not support recording a spatial definition for unit parcels. Instead
      only basic details for the units need to be captured such as the unit lot and plan number and
      the unit area.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Lodge an Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The first step to record a new unit plan is to lodge a new application in SOLA containing a
      Record Unit Plan service. This should be done while the surveyor (or their representative) is
      in attendance so that you can provide them with the lodgement notice detailing the fees
      payable. <b>Important:</b> The Unit Title services must be enabled before they will be
      available for selection in the Add Service dialog.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the surveyor as the Agent. Check the contact details for the
            surveyor are appropriate and update if required. If the surveyor is not listed in the
            drop down list, choose the Other Agent option at the top of the list and enter the
            contact details for the surveyor in the fields provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, add the Record Unit Plan service to the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the folio reference for the property underlying the Unit
            Title Development and add it to the application using the Add property button. You
            should verify each property using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/verify.png">Verify tool to confirm SOLA contains the appropriate
            details to process the plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Important</b>: If the Verify tool indicates the underlying property record does not
            exist in SOLA (i.e. Title exists column is unchecked) you will first need to ensure the
            property record is created by the Land Registration Team using the Convert Paper Title
            service before proceeding with this application.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the surveyor.
            At a minimum the Record Unit Plan services requires a Unit Plan document. 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can optionally enter a reference number for the document and a description. The
                reference number should be taken from the physical document. If the physical
                document does not have any reference number, then this field should be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. E.g. For the plan, the name of the surveyors firm or the surveyors name
                can be entered here. This field is optional and can be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link in the scanned
                image. If you have not yet scanned the document, you will need to do this at a
                later stage and link it into the document using the Edit Document functionality
                available from Document Search.&nbsp;
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Map points tab, navigate the map to the location of the plan and add one or more
            application points using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Fees tab, enter the number of units that will be created by the plan and click
            the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save button. This will lodge the
            application and produce the lodgment notice. Print the notice and give it to the
            surveyor (or their representative) as proof the application has been lodged. The
            lodgment notice will indicate the fee to be paid for the application as well as the
            date the application should be completed processing (30 days from the date of
            lodgment).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Fee Payment
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the lodgment notice is printed, the surveyor will need to take the notice to the
      cashier in the finance section and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier
      will<img style=" margin-left: 40.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/folder-open-document.png">Open the application from the Unassigned
      application list in the SOLA Desktop and check the Fee Paid flag on the Fees tab to indicate
      the application can continue processing.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Assign the Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before work can begin on recording the unit plan information in SOLA, the application must
      first get assigned to a QA user. Assignment of the application indicates that work on the
      plan is underway.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the SOLA Dashboard, check the Unassigned applications list to confirm the fee for
            the application has been paid. If the fee has not been paid it will not be possible to
            assign the application. In this situation contact the surveyor and/or cashier to
            confirm the payment status for the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the application fee has been paid, select the application in the Unassigned
            applications list and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/assign.png">Assign
            tool. This will open the Application Assignment screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign action is complete,
            you will be returned to the Dashboard and the assigned application will appear in your
            Assigned applications list.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Typically users will only be able to assign applications to themselves (i.e. they will be
      able to pull work), however team leaders will be able to manage the workload of their teams
      and will be able to assign and reassign applications to other users. Note that the<img style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/unassign.png">Un-assign and<img
      style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/assign.png">Assign tools can be

    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Manual Assessment
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The QA user assigned to the application will perform the necessary manual checks to confirm
      the unit plan complies with the appropriate regulations as described in the applicable Unit
      Title Acts. If the assessment of the plan is successful, the QA user can begin recording the
      details of the unit plan in SOLA using the Record Unit Plan service. If the assessment
      reveals issues with the plan that must be addressed by the surveyor, then the plan will need
      to be requisitioned. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Requisitioning and Resubmitting the Plan
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When the unit plan requires requisition it will be necessary to update the application in
      SOLA to the Requisitioned status.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Confirm the unit plan requires requisition with the appropriate team leader.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the requisition notice describing the issues that need to be addressed by the
            surveyor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the application from the Assigned applications list in the Dashboard. Go to the
            Documents tab and create a new Requisition Notice document with the requisition notice
            as the attachment. Attaching the requisition notice to the application will ensure the
            reasons for requisitioning the plan are recorded in SOLA.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the Application action dropdown, select the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/requisition.png">Requisition action. This will update the application
            status to Requisitioned and remove the application from your Assigned applications
            list. If the Requisition action is not enabled on the Application action dropdown,
            confirm the application is assigned to you and that you have the Requisition
            Application role by asking IT Services to check your SOLA User setup.

       It is possible the surveyor may choose to withdraw the survey following requisition. This
      can be achieved by using the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/withdraw.png">Withdraw action on the Application action dropdown.
      Alternatively, if the plan remains on requisition for an extended period, and no further
      information is provided by the surveyor, the application can be lapsed using the<img style=

       Record Unit Plan Service
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Record Unit Plan service provides tools that allow you to capture basic details for the
      principal and accessory units identified on the unit plan.

          </li>
          <li>
            Enter the official area for the Common Property by double clicking in the Official Area
            column in the Unit Parcels table. If there is no Common Property for the Unit Title
            Development, set the area to 0. Note that SOLA requires every Unit Title Development to
            include a Common Property parcel even if there is no common property identified on the
            unit plan itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            If CP is not the correct Lot / Parcel Number for the Common Property parcel, double

            the total area for all unit parcels including the common property matches the area of
            the underlying parcel. If you enter the wrong area or Lot number, double click the
