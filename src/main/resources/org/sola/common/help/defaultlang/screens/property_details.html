       The Property Details screen allows you to view or edit property details. You can access the
      Property Details screen in view only mode by opening a search result from the Property Search
      screen. To edit property details, you must first lodge an application that contains a
      Registration Service such as Transfer or Record Mortgage, assign the application and then<img

      from the Application Details Service tab. The Land Registration How To section discusses how
      to process various Registration Services using the Property Details screen.

       A property links the rights and restrictions over a parcel to the individuals or groups
      (i.e. parties) that hold those rights. The information represented by the property is often
      referred to as the Title. For SOLA Samoa, a property is the equivalent of a Computer Folio.
      Details that can be captured for a property include

             Typically the primary right for a property is the right of ownership (e.g. Freehold,
            Leasehold, Government or Customary). Properties can have one or many owners each with a
            share in the property that may be explicitly defined (tenants in common) or undivided
            (joint tenants).
          </p>
          <p>
             The Ownership tab is intended to provide quick access to current as well as pending
            (i.e. unregistered) ownership details. Note that any changes in ownership must captured
            on the primary right in the Rights / Restrictions tab using the appropriate
            Registration Service.
