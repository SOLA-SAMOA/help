       Create Unit Title Folios
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the unit plan is approved, folios for the unit parcels can be created by the Land
      Registration Team using the Create Unit Titles service.&nbsp; Note that the Create Unit
      Titles service can also be used to create any additional folios for the unit development
      following the approval of a Redevelopment plan.

       Lodge Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A member of the Land Registration Team will lodge a new application to create the Unit Title
      folios when they see an approved Record Unit Plan application appear in the Unassigned
      Applications list.

        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, enter the Agent (i.e. surveyor) details as noted on the application
            used to process the unit plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab add the Create Unit Titles service. Only one Create Unit Titles
            service is required regardless of the number of unit titles that must be created.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the folio reference for the underlying property of the unit
            plan. <b>Important</b>: This must be the same underlying property that was recorded for
            the Record Unit Plan application.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, create a Unit Plan document and use the Document search to link
            to the approved unit plan image.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create documents for the Body Corporate Rules and Schedule of Unit Entitlements,
            linking these documents to their scanned copies if available.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            On the fees tab, check the Fee Paid checkbox as the Create Unit Titles service does not
            incur any fees, then click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save
            button. This will lodge the application and produce the lodgment notice. You can close
            the lodgment notice without printing it. If you do not have permission to check the Fee
            Paid checkbox, save the application and arrange for a person with the appropriate
            privilege to do this for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the new Land Registration application has been lodged, open the approved
            application used to process the unit plan and archive it using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/archive.png">Archive action in the Application action dropdown.

            The Property Details screen will display. Check each tab of the Property Details
            screen. You will see that many of the details for the Common Property have already been
            set such as the area, the parcel as well as the Related properties. You will also see
            three rights on the Rights/Restrictions tab; Body Corporate Rules, Address for Service
            and an ownership right that will be Leasehold or Freehold depending on the estate type
            of the underlying property.

          <li>
            On the Parcels tab you will see the Principal Unit parcel. SOLA does not create folios
            for Accessory Units as they must reference a Principal Unit. If there are any Accessory
            Units related to this Principal Unit, use the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/add.png">Add parcel to search and link those Accessory Unit parcels to
            this Principal Unit folio. <b>Important:</b> For each Accessory Unit you add to the
            Principal Unit, you will need to increase the area of the Principal Unit folio
            accordingly so that the folio represents the combined area of the Principal Unit parcel
            and all of the Accessory Unit parcels.

            In the Unit Entitlement field, enter the sum of the unit entitlements for this
            Principal Unit and any Accessory Units linked to it. SOLA does not support recording
            the unit entitlement for the Principal Unit and each Accessory Unit individually. The
            Unit Entitlement document can be viewed if individual entitlements must be determined.
          </li>

          <li>
            By default, the ownership right identifies the owner(s) of the underlying property as
            the owner(s) for the Principal Unit property. Update the ownership details if required.
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            Check that the Village and Common Property details on the Related property tab are
            correct and update them if required. <b>Note:</b> Only the Common Property will
            reference the underlying property as its Prior Title. Principal Units should only
            reference the Village and the Common Property. This ensures changes to the underlying
            property can be easily managed without needing to update all Principal Units.

            At approval of the Create Unit Titles application, several actions occur. The Principal
            Units folios and Common Property folio become Current. If the underlying property is a
            Freehold estate, it will become Dormant. The reason the underlying property is not made
            historic/cancelled, is that it may be reinstated at a later time if the Unit Title
            Development is subsequently cancelled. It is also necessary to maintain the underlying
            property in case a redevelopment plan results in subdivision or amalgamation of the
            underlying property.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the underlying property is Leasehold, it will remain Current to reflect its
            Leasehold status.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once registered, the unit title folios can be treated the same as any other folio in
            SOLA. It is possible to register and discharge mortgages, change ownership or preform
            any of the other registration transactions against the unit title folios including the
            Common Property folio. Transactions pertaining to Accessory Units such as leasing of an
            Accessory Unit should also be registered on the Principal Unit folio along with an
            appropriate memorial.
