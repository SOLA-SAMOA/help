       Power of Attorney
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A Power of Attorney is a legal document that authorises a person (attorney) to act on behalf
      of another person (grantor) in private affairs, business or some other legal matter. Power of
      Attorney documents can be registered in SOLA and linked into applications to justify land
      transactions made by the attorney on behalf of the grantor.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       It is possible to search for registered Power of Attorney documents using the Document
      search, however the Power of Attorney tab provides additional search criteria allowing you to
      search for Power of Attorney documents using the Attorney name or the name of the person the
      attorney is acting on behalf of (i.e. grantor).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Both searches will return current and historic (i.e. cancelled) Power of Attorney documents
      however these searches exclude new Power of Attorney documents that are not yet registered.
      To search for pending Power of Attorney documents, use the Application Search to locate the
      document using the Document reference number.
