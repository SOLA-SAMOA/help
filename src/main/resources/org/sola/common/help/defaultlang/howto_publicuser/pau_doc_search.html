       <img src="../images/icons/search.png" hspace="4">Document Search allows you to find
      documents of interest for viewing or printing. SOLA Public Access only allows access to
      survey related plans and documents. In most cases the Number criteria will be the best search
      value to use. This maps to the survey plan number for survey plans. The document search uses
      partial matching, so you only need to enter part of the value to find a match.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       You can use any combination of search criteria to filter results. The Source criteria will
      usually be the name of the entity that submitted the documents (e.g. the name of the survey
      firm), &nbsp;Submission date is the date the document was submitted to SOLA &nbsp;and the
      Document date is the date printed or written on the face of the document.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       You can also use the Map Viewer to locate survey plan numbers that you can then use to
      search for the survey plan document. Simply zoom into the area of interest on the map and
      take note of the Application numbers (i.e. red crosses) shown in that area. Use the
      application number as the Number criteria in the Documents Search.
