       Cancel Titles and Create New Titles
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Create New Title service can be used to create a new Customary, Freehold, Government or
      Leasehold titles over new parcels created as a result of plan subdivision (e.g. Record Plan)
      or similar actions. The Cancel Title service can be used to cancel a title by changing the
      status of a property to Historic. The Cancel Title and Create New Title service usually go
      together as it is often necessary to cancel a title so that one or more new titles can be
      created in its place. Note that the Cancel Title and Create New Title services can be used
      independently although Cancel Title should be used with caution if there is no new title to
      replace the one being cancelled.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The trigger for creating new titles will usually be the approval of an application with a
      Record Plan service. As part of the plan approval, QA will create a new application with a
      Cancel Title service and the appropriate number of Create New Title services (one for each
      new lot that requires a title). QA will also link the plan image to the new application so
      that Land Registration can determine the parcels to reference when creating the new titles.

       Verify Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before processing the application to create new titles, you should check that it contains
      the appropriate number of services by referring to the details of the
      plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Verify that the application has a Plan document with the image of the approved plan
            associated to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review the plan image and confirm that the application has a Cancel Title service if
            the plan extinguishes any parcels due to subdivision or amalgamation. Note that only
            one Cancel Title service is required even if there are multiple titles to cancel.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that all of the titles for the underlying parcels on the plan (i.e. the parcels
            being subdivided or amalgamated) have been added on the Property tab of the
            application. The Cancel Title service will only allow cancellation of those properties
            listed in the Property tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that the application has a Create New Title service for each new lot that
            requires a title. For example, if there are 5 new lots requiring titles, then ensure
            there are 5 Create New Title services on the application. A Create New Title service
            can only be used to create one title.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are any issues with the application, add or remove services as necessary
            and/or consult with the QA staff member that created the application.
          </li>

       Cancel Titles
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Use the Cancel Title service to cancel the titles for the extinguished parcels. Note that if
      there are no titles to cancel, this step can be skipped.

        You can reverse the cancellation at any time prior to the approval of the application by
