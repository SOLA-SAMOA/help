       You can produce a Computer Folio Certificate for the property by clicking the Print Options
      dropdown and selecting the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/print.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;">Certificate option. If the property is linked to a parcel with a
      spatial definition, the shape of the parcel will be included on the second page of the
      Certificate.

       When printing a property report, you will be prompted to indicate if the report is being
      generated as a staff request or for a client. Indicate the appropriate option and click the
      Print button on the Certificate Print Log dialog. A read only history of all prints is
      displayed on the General tab of the Property Details screen.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The ability to produce a Certificate of Title (CoT) instead of the Computer Folio
      Certificate (CFC) has been added into version v2001a of SOLA. The cutover date from CFC's to
      CoT's is currently proposed for the 2nd March 2021. This date is the 12-year milestone since
      CFC's were introduced, however this date may be changed depending on the readiness of parties
      to accept the CoTs (i.e. banks, MNRE, land owners, etc). Once the cutover date is agreed,
      SOLA will require a configuration change before it will be possible to produce the CoT's.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Note that following the cutover date, CFC's will continue to be produced as the search copy
      for all property until such time as a dealing is registered on a property. Dealing
      registration will trigger the CoT to be produced for that property and any subsequent
      dealings or search copies for that property will also produce the CoT. This will ensure
      current holders of CFC's are not disadvantaged by needing to produce additional proof of
      ownership information after the CoT cutover date.
