       Spatial&nbsp;Features
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Spatial Feature Tools let you add, edit or remove hydro, road or village spatial
      features as well as Traverse Marks and District Boundaries from the map. This includes
      changing the name of a road, village, stream or lake.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before you can edit or change an existing spatial feature, you first have to select it using
      the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/zone.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Select
      Feature tool. This will highlight the feature with a dark blue boarder and light yellow fill.
      The node points of the features will be highlighted with light red squares. The tool also
      allows you to deselect a feature that has been selected in error. Simply click the feature
      again using the tool to toggle its selection state.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layer-vector.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Edit
      Spatial Feature tool lets you change the shape of a selected feature by dragging the node
      points of the feature (highlighted as light red squares) with the mouse. This tool also
      allows you to add a new node point to the feature using a single click of the mouse on or
      near the feature boundary. To remove a node from the feature, hold down the Shift key and
      single click on the node you want to remove.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To view and edit details of the spatial feature, click the<img hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/table-pencil.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Edit Spatial Feature Details
      tool. This will display the Edit Spatial Feature screen.
    </p>
    <p align="center" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <img src="../images/23g_spatial_features.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
    </p>
    <p align="center" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Edit Spatial Feature Screen</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Using this screen you can change the label for the feature (i.e. the feature name) or mark
      the feature for deletion (by checking the Delete on approval check box) which will completely
      remove the feature from the map. If the feature is a Traverse Mark, you can also edit the
      Northing and Easting coordinates. Note that changes to spatial features are not applied until
      the application is approved.&nbsp; Until that time, the only place to view the new name
      assigned to the spatial feature or whether it is marked for deletion is this screen.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       In addition to editing details of the feature, it is also possible to deselect a spatial
      feature using the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/remove.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;">Remove button. This is the equivalent of deselecting the feature
      using the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/zone.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Select
      Spatial Feature tool and will not cause the feature to be deleted from the map when the
      application is approved.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When you click a feature in the Edit Spatial Features screen it will highlight the feature
      on the map to provide visual confirmation of the feature being changed. You can remove this
      highlight using the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/selection.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;">Clear button.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layers-group.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Merge
      can be used to create a new feature from two or more existing spatial features within the
      same layer (e.g. merge multiple road parcels into one). You need to select the features you
      want to merge from the map first, then using the Edit Spatial Feature screen, check the Merge
      checkbox (left column in table) to indicate which features are to merge. Once all features
      are checked, click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layers-group.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;">Merge button. Note that the features selected for merge must
      spatially overlap otherwise the merge will fail.
    </p>

      tool and the <img src="../images/icons/node-design.png" hspace="4">Add District Boundary
      tool&nbsp;can be used to create new hydro parcels, new road parcels, new road centerlines,
      new Village points, new Traverse Marks and new District Boundaries&nbsp;as required. Once
      created, you can use the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layer-vector.png" style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;">Edit Spatial Feature tool as well as the<img hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/table-pencil.png" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">Edit Spatial Feature screen
      to update the new feature information. Note that any new features created when processing a
      Record Plan (or Change Map) service will not be visible to other users until the application
      is approved.&nbsp;
