       Spatial&nbsp;Features
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Spatial Feature Tools let you add, edit or remove hydro, road or village spatial
      features from the map. This includes changing the name of a road, village, stream or lake.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Before you can edit or change an existing spatial feature, you first have to select it using
      the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/zone.png">Select
      Feature tool. This will highlight the feature with a dark blue boarder and light yellow fill.
      The node points of the features will be highlighted with light red squares. The tool also
      allows you to deselect a feature that has been selected in error. Simply click the feature
      again using the tool to toggle its selection state.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layer-vector.png">Edit
      Spatial Feature tool lets you change the shape of a selected feature by dragging the node
      points of the feature (highlighted as light red squares) with the mouse. This tool also
      allows you to add a new node point to the feature using a single click of the mouse on or
      near the feature boundary. To remove a node from the feature, hold down the Shift key and
      single click on the node you want to remove.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To view and edit details of the spatial feature, click the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"
      hspace="4" src="../images/icons/table-pencil.png">Edit Spatial Feature Details tool. This
      will display the Edit Spatial Feature screen.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" align="center">
       <img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" src="../images/23g_spatial_features.png">
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" align="center">
       <b>Edit Spatial Feature Screen</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Using this screen you can change the label for the feature (i.e. the feature name) or mark
      the feature for deletion (by checking the Delete on approval check box) which will completely
      remove the feature from the map. Note that changes to spatial features are not applied until
      the application is approved.&nbsp; Until that time, the only place to view the new name
      assigned to the spatial feature or whether it is marked for deletion is this screen.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       In addition to editing details of the feature, it is also possible to deselect a spatial
      feature using the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/remove.png">Remove button. This is the equivalent of deselecting the feature
      using the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/zone.png">Select
      Spatial Feature tool and will not cause the feature to be deleted from the map when the
      application is approved.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When you click a feature in the Edit Spatial Features screen it will highlight the feature
      on the map to provide visual confirmation of the feature being changed. You can remove this
      highlight using the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/selection.png">Clear button.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/layers-group.png">Merge
      can be used to create a new feature from two or more existing spatial features within the
      same layer (e.g. merge multiple road parcels into one). You need to select the features you
      want to merge from the map first, then using the Edit Spatial Feature screen, check the Merge
      checkbox (left column in table) to indicate which features are to merge. Once all features
      are checked, click the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/layers-group.png">Merge button. Note that the features selected for merge
      must spatially overlap otherwise the merge will fail.

      created when processing a Record Plan (or Change Map) service will not be visible to other
      users until the application is approved.&nbsp;
