       Business Rules
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA employs business rules to automatically validate the data entered by a user to ensure
      consistency of the data as well as warning the user of potential irregularities. Business
      rules are usually executed just prior to changes in state of an application or a service
      (e.g. application approval) but can also be manually triggered using the Validation tool in
      the Application Details screen.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       All business rules have a severity rating and the failure of any critical business rule will
      cause the current action to be aborted. In this situation, the user will be required to
      remedy the issue reported by the failed critical rule(s) before processing can
      continue.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The results of the business rules are displayed in the Business Rule Feedback popup. Each
      row in the Feedback popup represents a business rule that has been executed by the validation
      process. The first column is a message that describes the business rule from the perspective
      that the business rule passes. The last column contains either a green traffic light icon
      repressing a pass of the business rule or a red traffic light representing a fail. The
      severity rating for each business rule is also listed. As noted above, any critical fails
      from an automated validation will prevent the current process from completing until the
      critical fail has been remedied. Other severity fails will not abort the current action
      allowing the process to complete.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The default ordering of the validation checks is for fails to appear at the top ordered by
      severity.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Where possible, business rules are defined in such a way that if they are irrelevant to a
      particular situation, they are excluded and do not appear in the Feedback popup. Sometimes
      the complexity of a business rule prevents this screening process and you may find business
      rules listed that are not particularly relevant to the current situation. Similarly, not all
      business rules can be automated and so this form of checking should not be considered the
      only checking method. However, if you identify a new business rule that you think could be
      automated, contact the SOLA support team with details.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A complete listing of all business rules including what remedial action should be taken is
      included in Appendix 1 – SOLA Business Rules.
