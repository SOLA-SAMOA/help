       Creating Parcels with Irregular Boundaries
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Create New Parcel tool allows you to create new parcels with simple right-line
      boundaries where the start and end point for each boundary line must be a survey point. If
      the parcel requires an irregular boundary (a.k.a. natural boundary) then you need to use the
      Boundary Change tools to modify the right line boundary line of a new parcel. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>IMPORTANT</b>: Before using the Boundary Change tools, ensure you add all existing
      parcels that will share the irregular boundary as target parcels. Only modifying a parcel on
      one side of the boundary may result in gaps and overlaps forming in the cadastral network. To
      do this may require to you add parcels that are not recorded on the plan. You also need to
      re-create new parcels over all target parcels using the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"
      hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new-parcel.png">Create New Parcels tool prior to using the
      Boundary Change tools. The exception to this rule is where the irregular boundary will form
      the shoreline of a lake or the sea. In this case it is unlikely there will be an adjacent
      parcel to update.

       The<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src=
      "../images/icons/cadastre-boundary-select.png">Select Boundary tool can be used to identify
      the boundary line(s) of a new parcel that must be changed into an irregular boundary. Use the
      tool to select the start and end points of the irregular boundary by dragging a small
      selection box around the appropriate new parcel node when prompted to do so by the tool.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The order that you select the start and end points for the new irregular boundary is
      important. The tool will highlight all parcel boundary line(s) in a clockwise direction from
      the start point to the end point. The highlighted boundary lines indicate the boundary lines
      that will be replaced by the new irregular boundary. If the wrong sequence of boundary lines
      is highlighted, repeat the selection ensuring the end point is selected as the start point
      and vice versa.

       Selecting a boundary to change will enable the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4"

      initial boundary that approximately represents the new boundary you require. You can then
      zoom in and use the Boundary Change tools to improve segments of the initial boundary as
      required.
