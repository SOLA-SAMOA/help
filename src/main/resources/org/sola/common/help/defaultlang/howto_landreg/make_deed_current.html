       Make an Historic Deed Current
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       All of the deeds migrated into SOLA were migrated with an historic/cancelled status to
      prevent further actions or changes to those deeds. If it becomes necessary to lodge a dealing
      against an historic deed, the deed must be updated to a Current status to allow the dealing
      to be lodged. This can be achieved using the <img src="../images/icons/arrow-return.png"
      hspace="4">&nbsp;Make Current feature that is available on the Property Details screen for
      historic deeds
