       Record a Plan with a Plan Number allocated by LRS
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       It is possible that the plan you are working on was allocated a plan number by LRS but was
      not captured into DCDB. In this situation it is important to explicitly set the plan number
      before lodging the application so that the application number in SOLA matches the number
      noted on the plan.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       When Recording a Plan, set the appropriate application number on the General tab. The
      Application # field will only be editable if you have the Set Application Number security
      role and the application is yet to be lodged. Be very careful setting this number. If the
      lodgment fails, it is likely because the number you have set duplicates an existing number.
      Once the application is lodged, it is not possible to change the application number.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Important:</b> Do not set the plan number to any value above 11,000. SOLA automatically
      allocates numbers above 11,000. If you do set an application number to a value greater than
      11,000 SOLA will eventually reach the number and it will prevent further applications from
      being lodged.
