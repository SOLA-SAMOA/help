       Correct the Registry
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Correct Registry services can be used to correct erroneous details on the property on
      behalf of the Registrar. They allow

    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            any rights or restrictions to be added, changed or cancelled
          </li>
          <li>
            the estate type of the property to be changed
          </li>
          <li>
            memorials to be added to the property
          </li>
          <li>
            the prior title and village parent property details added, changed or removed
          </li>
          <li>
            the property area to be modified
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       These services do not allow the property to be cancelled or the folio reference to be
      changed. To cancel a property, use the Cancel Title service. Changing the folio reference is
      not recommended as there may be legal documents that reference the folio. Instead the
      property should be cancelled and a new property with a different folio created in its place
      (using the Create New Title service).
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA does not allow the same service to create, change and cancel rights. For this reason
      there are two Correct Registry services, Correct Registry and Correct Registry (Cancel
      Right). These services can be used independently or in combination as required.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       An Office Note must accompany these services to describe and justify the changes made to the
      property. No fee is charged for these services.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Use the Correct Registry service to record new rights, change existing rights, add property
      memorials, change prior title and village parent property details and edit the property area.
