       Services are a key component of SOLA as they control the changes that can be made to the
      land register and cadastre information maintained by SOLA. Every application lodged in SOLA
      must include at least one service. In cases where several changes to the land registry or
      cadastre information are required as part of a single application, you can choose to add
      multiple services to the application. The categories of services supported by SOLA are

      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            Registration Services
          </li>
          <li>
            Survey Services
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting Services
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Changes made to the land register information as part of a service must be justified by a
      document of some kind. This could be a completed application form requesting a particular
      change or it could be a legal or official document (e.g. survey plan) describing a change to
      the land register information. These documents must be scanned and linked to the SOLA
      application in support of services.&nbsp; If the documents required by a service are not
      linked to the application, SOLA will not allow the service to be completed. The documents
      required for each service are noted in the following sections. You can obtain more details
      about a specific document type from the Documents section.
