    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       SOLA allows registered Standard Memorandum documents to be linked into new applications as
      well as linked to specific property rights and restrictions such as a mortgage right.
    </p>

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>

        <ol>
          <li>
            When creating a new application that must reference a Standard Memorandum document, use
            the Documents tab on the Application Details screen to enter details appropriate for
            the Standard Memorandum
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the ... button in the Attachment field and use the Document search tab in the
            File Attachment dialog to search for and locate the Standard Memorandum document.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select and attach the appropriate Standard Memorandum document to your new application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue with the application lodgement as per normal.
          </li>
          <li>
            When editing the rights or restrictions of the property or properties affected by the
            application, you can also choose to link the Standard Memorandum document directly to
            the right/restriction using the Documents section of the right/restriction form.&nbsp;
            For example, you may choose to link a Standard Memorandum document describing the terms
            and conditions for a mortgage to the applicable mortgage right on the affected
            property.&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Document search will only show registered Standard Memorandum documents. It is not
        possible to link to documents that are not registered or have been revoked.
      </li>
    </ul>
