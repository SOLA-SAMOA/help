       Supporting Services do not necessarily result in changes to the land registry or cadastre
      information, but can be used to address requests for information by agents. They can also be
      used to register or de-register official documentation such as Power of Attorney and Standard
      Memorandum. Registration of these documents allows them to be used to support subsequent
      property transactions. &nbsp;
