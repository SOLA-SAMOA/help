       Lodge a Redevelopment Plan
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A Redevelopment Plan describes changes to a Unit Title Development due to any of the
      following
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subdivision (reduction) of an existing unit or units
          </li>
          <li>
            Enlargement of a unit
          </li>
          <li>
            Erection of one or more new units
          </li>
          <li>
            Removal or one or more existing units
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       It is a legal requirement that Redevelopment Plans retain the number assigned to the
      original Standard Unit Development once the redevelopment plan is approved. To satisfy this
      requirement, and avoid confusion with the original plan, SOLA applies a temporary numeric
      suffix (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) to the redevelopment plan up until it is approved. Once approved
      the redevelopment plan is given the original plan number (excluding any suffix) while earlier
      approved plans for the development are assigned an alphabetic suffix (e.g. A, B, C, etc.)

       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lodge an application with the Record Unit Plan service. You must add a folio from the
            Unit Title Development to the Property tab of Application Details before you lodge the
            application. The recommended folio to use is the Common Property folio (e.g. CP/11000).
          </li>
          <li>
            After lodging the application you will note the Application No. matches the original
            Unit Title Development Plan Number and includes a numeric suffix (e.g. 11000/2). Note
            that the first suffix number assigned will be 2 as this will be the second plan lodged
            for the Unit Title Development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure you are Assignee for the redevelopment application and open it from your
            Dashboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/start.png">Start the Record Unit Plan service. The
            Unit Titles screen will open.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any existing unit parcels are being enlarged or reduced in size by the redevelopment
            plan, update their Official Area values on the Unit parcels tab. This applies to all
            unit parcels whether they are Principal Units, Accessory Units or the Common Property.
            &nbsp;SOLA will check that the total area for all unit parcels including the common
            property matches the area of the underlying parcel.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any existing unit parcels are being removed by the Redevelopment Plan, select the
            parcel and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/remove.png">Remove tool. This
            will flag the parcel as Delete on Approval and ensure the parcel is removed from the
            Unit Title Development when the application is approved. <b>Note:</b> SOLA will not let
            you remove the Common Property parcel. If the Common Property is completely taken by
            the Redevelpment Plan for other units, set the area of the Common Property to 0
            instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/add.png">Add tool to add any new Principal
            or Accessory Units to the Unit Title Development. The Add tool will automatically
            increment the Lot / Parcel Number; however you can edit this value if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a new unit parcel that was added by mistake, use the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/remove.png">Remove tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have completed the necessary changes, click<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/save.png">Save. Business rules will run and inform you of any
            inconsistences or issues with the data. If all business rules pass, close the Record
            Unit Plan screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Service tab of the Application Details screen, select the Record Unit Plan
            Service and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/confirm.png">Complete tool.
            This will run the SOLA business rules to validate the application data. If there is a
            critical failure, you must remedy the failure as it will not be possible to approve the
            application otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue and approve the application using the normal procedures.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Notes</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            When the application is approved, you will notice that the Application No. suffix is
            removed and the Redevelopment Plan will be assigned the original plan number for the
            Unit Title Development. If you check the earlier plan applications for the development,
            you will see they have been assigned an alphabetic suffix with A being the earliest. It
            is possible for gaps to occur in the alphabetic suffixing in the case where a
            Redevelopment Plan is cancelled before approval.

            Lodge an application with the Create Unit Titles service. You must add a folio from the

          <li>
            If any of the Principal Units have been removed from the development or dissolved into
            the Common Property, add a Cancel Title service to the application and also add those
            unit title folios to be cancelled to the Property tab of Application Details.
