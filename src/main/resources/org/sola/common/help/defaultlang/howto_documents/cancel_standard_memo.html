       This service can be used to revoke the registration of a Standard Memorandum. As with the
      Cancel Power of Attorney service, the cancelled memorandum will remain linked to any
      applications or property transactions it was associated with prior to being revoked but it
      will not be possible to us the memorandum on any new applications.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The process for canceling a Standard Memorandum is very similar to that for canceling a
      Power of Attorney. Refer to the steps described in the Cancel Power of Attorney section for
      guidance. Note that you will need to use the standard Document search on the Document
      Registration screen to locate the Standard Memorandum to revoke.
