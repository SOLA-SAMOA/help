    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       To attach a file to a new document, click the “...” button in the Attachment text
      field.&nbsp; The File Attachment dialog will display and you will be able to use it to select
      a file from your local computer file system, the remote file location configured for SOLA or
      search for a file that has already been uploaded into SOLA.

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Remote disk view displays files that have been placed in a specific network file system
      location e.g. the output folder configured for a network attached scanner. Thumbnail previews
      are supported for standard image formats (png, tiff, jpg) as well as PDF.

       <b>File Attachment Document search tab</b>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The Document search allows you to search existing SOLA documents for a file that was
      previously attached. This can be a useful way to link Power of Attorney and Standard
      Memorandum into the application as well as reference other documentation that may be relevant
      to the application.
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once you have chosen the document to attach, click the<img style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"
      hspace="4" src="../images/icons/paper-clip.png">Attach button on the appropriate tab of the
      File Attachment dialog. This will return you to the Documents tab (or screen) and the
      filename of the attachment will be display in the Attachment text field along with a <img
      style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/delete_icon.gif">remove icon.
      If you select the wrong file as the attachment, you can click the remove icon to remove the
      file attachment.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The maximum size of a file that can be attached into SOLA is 100Mb. Files larger than
            this should be resized or split and added as 2 or more documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although the Document search tab allows you to search all SOLA documents, only the file
            attachment is linked through to the new document record. Attempting to attach an
            existing document record that has no file attachment (i.e. no<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/paper-clip.png">in the ... column) has no effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Power of Attorney and Standard Memorandum must be registered in SOLA before they can be
            located using the Document search.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you successfully attach a file from the Remote disk, the file will be automatically
            deleted from the remote file location.
          </li>
          <li>
            The File Attachment dialog can be resized to enlarge the document preview if required.
