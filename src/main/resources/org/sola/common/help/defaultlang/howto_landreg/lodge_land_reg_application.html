       Lodge and Process a Land Registration Application
    </h1>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The following provides detailed steps on how to lodge and process a land registration
      application. For information on how to process Land Registration services, refer to the
      appropriate Land Registration How To section.
    </p>
    <h2 style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Lodge an Application
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       The first step when making changes to the land registry is to create an application with the
      appropriate service or services. Where those services are likely to require payment, lodging
      the application should be done while the agent (or their representative) is in attendance so
      that you can provide them with the lodgment notice detailing the fees payable.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <b>Steps</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li style=" list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the Dashboard select the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/new.png">New
            application tool to open the Application Details screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the General tab, select the appropriate agent from the Agent dropdown. If the person
            making the request is not listed in the drop down list, choose the Other Agent option
            at the top of the list and enter the contact details for the person in the fields
            provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Services tab, select one or more land registration services depending on the
            changes you need to make to the land registry. If you select more than one service, you
            should order the services in a logical sequence. E.g. for a discharge, transfer and
            mortgage, the Cancel Mortgage service should be at the top, followed by the Transfer
            service with the Record Mortgage service at the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Property tab, enter the folio reference for the property that is being changed
            and add them to the application using the Add property button. In the case of a new
            plan, you should add the folio references for the properties being subdivided or
            amalgamated (i.e. the properties that will be extinguished) by the plan.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            You should verify each property using the<img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/verify.png">Verify tool to confirm SOLA contains the appropriate
            details for the property. If the Title Exists checkbox is not checked, this may
            indicate the folio reference is invalid or the folio has yet to be converted from paper
            format. Use the Property Search screen and/or Map Find to attempt to locate the
            property record. If you are unsuccessful, check the paper records to determine if the
            property information must first be converted into SOLA before any land registration
            transactions can proceed (using the Convert to Title service).
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Documents tab, record each of the physical documents provided by the agent. The
            documents required are dependent on the service(s) selected. When capturing document
            information&nbsp; 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Ensure you select the appropriate document type and record the document date (i.e.
                the date recorded on the face of the physical document) or today’ s date if the
                physical document is not dated.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can optionally enter a reference number for the document and a description. The
                reference number should be taken from the physical document. If the physical
                document does not have any reference number, then this field should be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Source Agency is the name of the organization that created the physical
                document. E.g. For the POA, this may be the name of the grantor. This field is
                optional and can be left blank.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                   If you have scanned the document, use the Attachment field to link in the
                  scanned image. If you have not yet scanned the document, you will need to do this
                  at a later stage and link it into the document using the Edit Document
                  functionality available from Document Search.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            You should also attach a Proof of Identity document for the agent/applicant to the
            application. This could be a passport style photo the copy of a birth certificate. This
            can be linked directly to the property changes made for the application and used to
            help confirm the validity of future property transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Map points are optional for Land Registration applications. You can add one by
            navigating the map to the location of the property and using the <img hspace="4" src=
            "../images/icons/application-location-add.png">Add Application Point tool. If you are
            not sure of the location of the property and cannot locate it using the Map Find, then
            <b>do not</b> add an Application point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/save.png">Save button. This will lodge
            the application and produce the lodgment notice. Print the notice and give it to the
            agent as proof the application has been lodged. The lodgment notice will indicate the
            fee to be paid for the application.

       Fee Payment
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       Once the lodgment notice is printed, the agent will need to take the notice to the cashier
      in the finance section and arrange payment. When payment has been made, the cashier will
      locate the Unassigned application list on the SOLA Dashboard,<img style=
      " margin-left: 20.0px;" hspace="4" src="../images/icons/folder-open-document.png">Open the
      application and check the Fee Paid flag on the Fees tab to indicate the application can
      continue processing.

          <li>
            From the SOLA Dashboard, check the Unassigned applications list to confirm the fee for
            the application has been paid. If the fee has not been paid it will not be possible to
            assign the application. In this situation notify the agent and/or cashier to confirm
            the payment status for the application.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the application fee has been paid, select the application in the Unassigned
            applications list and click the<img hspace="4" src="../images/icons/assign.png">Assign
            tool. This will open the Application Assignment screen.

          <li>
            Click the Assign button to assign the application. When the Assign action is complete,
            you will be returned to the Dashboard and the assigned application will appear in your
            Assigned applications list.
