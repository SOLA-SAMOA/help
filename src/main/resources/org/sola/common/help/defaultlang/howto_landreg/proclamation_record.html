       Record Proclamation
    </h2>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       A Proclamation is a formal notice issued by the Government for the purpose of taking land
      from the Freehold estate and vesting it to the Government of Samoa, usually for public works.
      In SOLA, recording a Proclamation is the same as changing the estate type.
